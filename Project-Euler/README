A collection of solutions to mathematical problems, solved using computer programming in MATLAB. In the questions posed by Project Euler, programming intertwined with mathematics is necessary to achieve an elegant solution. Although any programming language can be used to solve these problems, I found MATLAB  to be the most efficient, as it is a numerical programming language.
